### Copies and Views

简单的赋值：

如下即简单的给 b 赋值，而不是将 a 的对象传递进来或者

``` python
>>> a = np.arange(12)
>>> b = a            # no new object is created
>>> b is a           # a and b are two names for the same ndarray object
True
>>> b.shape = 3,4    # changes the shape of a
>>> a.shape
(3, 4)
```

``` python
>>> c = a.view()
>>> c is a
False
>>> c.base is a                        # c is a view of the data owned by a
True
>>> c.flags.owndata
False
>>>
>>> c.shape = 2,6                      # a's shape doesn't change
>>> a.shape
(3, 4)
>>> c[0,4] = 1234                      # a's data changes
>>> a
array([[   0,    1,    2,    3],
       [1234,    5,    6,    7],
       [   8,    9,   10,   11]])
```
